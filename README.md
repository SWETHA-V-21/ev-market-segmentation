# Electric Vehicle (EV) Market Segmentation in India

This project analyzes the Indian Electric Vehicle (EV) market using clustering and segmentation techniques to help an EV startup decide:

1. What type of EVs to produce  
2. Which customer segments to target

The analysis is driven by data from EV sales records and a public KAP (Knowledge-Attitude-Practice) survey on EV adoption in India.

---

## Project Objectives

- Identify the most feasible EV vehicle types based on sales trends and revenue potential.
- Segment the population based on demographics, income, and EV awareness/attitudes to determine early adopters.
- Combine both vehicle and customer insights to build a targeted market entry strategy for an EV startup.

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn for clustering (KMeans)  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Insights

### Recommended EV Types for Production
- Electric Scooters (M-CYCLE/SCOOTER) and E-Rickshaws (E-RICKSHAW(P)) dominate sales and offer high revenue potential.
- High demand states: Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka.

### Customer Segmentation Results
Three segments were discovered:
- Segment 1 (Young males, medium-high income) shows highest EV awareness and adoption.
- Segment 0 (Older males, lower income) shows moderate adoption.
- Segment 2 (Middle-aged males, high income) shows lowest engagement.

---

## Final Recommendation

The EV startup should focus on producing electric scooters and e-rickshaws and initially target young, medium-income males in high-demand states. This group shows the strongest readiness and interest in EVs, making them ideal early adopters for a successful market launch.

- README.md – Project overview and summary

---

## Future Scope

- Incorporate more diverse customer data (e.g., female consumers, rural/urban divide).
- Expand segmentation to include psychographic and behavioral traits using survey questions.
- Use supervised models to predict future EV adoption likelihood.
